# IT-Education-Final
This work is my pet project. I used servlets, tomcat, jsp & other technologies. This application is designed for online IT-academies. 
Administrator can create, delete and launch courses, students and coaches can be registered and unregistered; coaches can estimate students and put marks down.
This application helps to organize the learning process.
